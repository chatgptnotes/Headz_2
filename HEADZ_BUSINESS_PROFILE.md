# Headz Hair Fixing: Complete Business Profile

**Headz Hair Fixing is a non-surgical hair restoration company founded in 2006 that has expanded to 38+ branches globally while facing significant quality control and customer service challenges despite strong market positioning in the rapidly growing hair restoration industry.**

The company operates in a lucrative market valued at $6.46 billion globally in 2023 and projected to reach $18.92 billion by 2030, but struggles with a mixed online reputation that reveals concerning patterns between marketing promises and service delivery quality.

## Company background and founding story

Dileep Mohan founded Headz Hair Fixing in 2006 in Bangalore after initially working for an international hair fixing company. Armed with a Professional Masters Degree and certification as a Wellness Consultant, Mohan identified an opportunity to create an "Indian version" of hair fixing specifically adapted for Indian climatic conditions. His research revealed that people were "fed up trying unscientific treatments," leading him to focus on non-surgical solutions using what the company calls "American technology."

From its single Bangalore outlet in 2006, Headz has grown to **38+ branches across multiple countries** and claims to have served over **100,000 customers** in 15+ years of operation. The expansion includes significant international presence in UAE, UK, and Kuwait, targeting both local markets and Indian diaspora communities.

## Services and business model

Headz specializes in **four primary non-surgical hair restoration methods**:

**Hair Bonding** uses imported dermatologically tested adhesives to permanently attach hair patches, requiring monthly maintenance that customers can perform using DIY kits. **Hair Weaving** involves creating knot wefts in existing hair strands and interlocking hair patches, with maintenance every two months. **Hair Clipping** provides temporary, removable solutions using clips with no maintenance requirements. **Hair Extensions** offer both permanent micro ring installations and temporary daily wear options in various styles and colors.

The company's core value proposition centers on **immediate transformation in just two hours** without surgery, pain, or lifestyle disruption. Customers can swim, travel in open vehicles, and engage in sports post-procedure. The business model relies on custom-made hair systems imported from South Korea, using 100% human hair (Indian Remy hair) and silicon-based scalp materials designed to mimic natural skin with abundant air circulation holes.

## Target market and demographics

Headz serves a broad demographic **from age 15 to 80**, targeting both men and women experiencing hair loss from various causes including hereditary baldness, stress, pollution, diabetes, and chemotherapy treatment. The company particularly appeals to working professionals seeking non-surgical alternatives to expensive hair transplants, with strong presence in IT hub cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, and Chennai.

Customer testimonials reveal satisfaction with confidence restoration and lifestyle improvement. Chandra Mohan, a two-year customer, states the service "helped me gain self confidence and you don't have to stand behind the crowd because of your baldness." However, the target market also includes cost-conscious consumers, as Pradeep Kumar notes "the cost is reasonable. Anybody facing baldness can easily afford this."

## Pricing structure and economics

Services range from **₹15,000 to ₹70,000** depending on hair quality, coverage area, and chosen materials. Natural human hair commands premium pricing, while machine-made or mixed options cost less. **Hair Extensions start at ₹9,000** and vary by length and density requirements.

**Maintenance costs** add significant ongoing revenue: Headz customers pay ₹900 for normal service or ₹1,500 for super premium service monthly, while outside customers pay ₹1,100. This recurring revenue model creates substantial lifetime customer value, though multiple customer complaints suggest pressure for cash-only payments and strict no-refund policies.

## Geographic presence and contact information

**Headquarters:** No.429, 2nd floor, 7th Main Road, HRBR Layout, Kalyan Nagar, Bangalore – 560043 (+91 98866 11110, contactus@refixmyhair.com)

The company operates **29+ locations across India** including Bangalore (3 branches), Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, and extensive coverage in Kerala, Karnataka, and other states. **International branches** include London (159 Ryefield Ave, Uxbridge), Portsmouth, Dubai/Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, and Kuwait, each with dedicated contact numbers and local staff.

## Team and leadership

**Dileep Mohan serves as Concept Director**, bringing professional Masters credentials and certified wellness consultant expertise. The company emphasizes having "the best technicians" working with advanced custom-made hair systems, though individual team member profiles remain limited beyond mentions of Mrs. Preethy Krishnan and Dr. Anjali L.

The leadership philosophy focuses on professional hair care and styling expertise, with Mohan's background in both international hair fixing companies and wellness consulting informing the company's approach to customer health and safety.

## Technology and methods

Headz employs what it terms **"American technology adapted for Indian climatic conditions"** using 100% Indian Remy hair processed and treated for reuse. The technical approach centers on **silicon-based patch materials** that mimic natural scalp with abundant air passage holes like human skin pores.

Key technological features include **advanced micro ring weaving** (replacing older clipping methods), custom hair system manufacturing matching original hair color and texture, and polymer-based non-natural scalp bases. The company imports hair systems from South Korea and uses temple natural remy hair for premium extensions, with dermatologically tested adhesives for bonding procedures.

## Online presence and reputation challenges

Headz maintains **substantial social media presence** with 21,000 Instagram followers, 25,651 Facebook likes, and strategic video marketing through YouTube testimonials that serve as primary customer acquisition tools. Regional accounts in Ahmedabad (1,555 followers), Kerala (813 followers), and other locations demonstrate localized marketing approaches.

However, **online reputation analysis reveals concerning patterns**. While some branches show strong ratings (4.4-4.7/5 on JustDial), detailed customer complaints on consumer forums reveal systematic issues including hair patches deteriorating within weeks, poor color/texture matching despite promises, and significant gaps between YouTube demonstration quality and actual service delivery.

**Negative feedback patterns** include uncomfortable clipping methods causing pain, thick black hair replacements for natural brown hair, pressure tactics for immediate cash payments, and poor customer service response to complaints. Multiple customers report traveling long distances based on convincing YouTube videos only to receive substandard results.

## Competitive positioning

Operating in a **$6.46 billion global hair restoration market** projected to reach $18.92 billion by 2030, Headz differentiates from surgical specialists like Bosley ($4,400-$12,000 transplant pricing) and Hair Club through its non-surgical focus and affordability positioning.

The company's **competitive advantages** include extensive branch network, 2-hour procedure times, no surgical requirements, and climate-adapted solutions. However, technological advancement by competitors using AI-enhanced robotic systems (FUEsion-X 5.0, ARTAS) and stem cell therapies presents ongoing competitive pressure.

**Market positioning** targets the affordability gap between expensive surgical procedures and basic hair products, though quality control issues threaten this positioning. The company faces competition from both premium international players entering Indian markets and budget online alternatives.

## Strategic assessment and outlook

Headz Hair Fixing operates in a high-growth industry with strong market fundamentals but faces **significant operational and reputational challenges**. The company's expansion to 38+ branches and claimed 100,000+ customer base demonstrates business model viability, while the non-surgical focus addresses real market demand for alternatives to expensive, invasive procedures.

**Critical success factors** include addressing quality control inconsistencies across branches, improving post-sale customer service, and maintaining competitive positioning against technologically advanced competitors. The company's climate adaptation narrative and affordability positioning provide sustainable differentiation opportunities, but only if service quality matches marketing promises.

**Future outlook** depends on resolving systematic quality issues while leveraging market growth opportunities in Asia-Pacific regions and Indian diaspora markets. Success requires balancing cost leadership with technology upgrades and maintaining customer trust through improved service consistency across the expanding branch network.
